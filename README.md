# taaspace

DEPRECATED: use [Tapspace](https://github.com/taataa/tapspace) instead.

Taaspace was a JavaScript lib for zoomable touch user interfaces until the project was renamed to Tapspace. Although [taaspace npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/taaspace) is kept up-to-date by exporting just and only the [tapspace npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tapspace), the semantic version is not increased and thus you should use Tapspace directly to get predictable version semantics.
